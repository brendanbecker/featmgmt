## Notes

This file tracks human actions that require manual intervention. Actions may block automated work items (bugs/features) from being processed.

**Key Fields:**
- **ID**: Action identifier (ACTION-XXX)
- **Title**: Brief description of what needs to be done
- **Urgency**: critical | high | medium | low (may be auto-calculated if blocking P0/P1 items)
- **Status**: pending | in_progress | completed
- **Blocking Items**: Bug or feature IDs that cannot proceed until this action is completed
- **Location**: Directory path to action details and INSTRUCTIONS.md

**Workflow:**
1. Create action directory: `human-actions/ACTION-XXX-slug/`
2. Add action_report.json with metadata
3. Add INSTRUCTIONS.md with detailed steps
4. Update this summary file with new action
5. When completed, move action to `completed/` directory
6. Update this summary file to remove completed action
