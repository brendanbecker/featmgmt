  "description": "The OVERPROMPT-standard.md workflow only processes bugs and skips features. When scan-prioritize-agent returns a queue with features but no bugs, the workflow exits to retrospective instead of processing the features. The bug-processor-agent is capable of processing both bugs and features (line 3: 'Processes bug/feature PROMPT.md files'), but the OVERPROMPT workflow only invokes it for bugs.",
  "steps_to_reproduce": [
    "Create features with PROMPT.md files in feature-management/features/",
    "Ensure no unresolved bugs exist in bugs/",
    "Run OVERPROMPT.md workflow",
    "Observe that scan-prioritize-agent identifies features",
    "Observe that workflow skips to Phase 6 (retrospective) instead of Phase 2 (processing)"
  ],
  "expected_behavior": "When the priority queue contains features and no bugs, the workflow should process the highest priority feature using bug-processor-agent.",
  "actual_behavior": "Workflow exits to retrospective when bug queue is empty, even though feature queue has unresolved items.",
  "evidence": {
    "overprompt_line_234": "IF queue empty → [Phase 6] INVOKE retrospective-agent",
    "overprompt_line_373": "IF no bugs: INVOKE retrospective-agent, then summary-reporter-agent",

    "scan_prioritize_output": "Scans both bugs/bugs.md AND features/features.md (line 15-16)"
  },
  "root_cause": "OVERPROMPT-standard.md was designed with bug-only workflow in mind. Phase 2 title and logic references only 'bugs' instead of generic 'items'. Exit conditions check 'IF no bugs' instead of 'IF queue empty'.",
  "impact": "Features never get processed autonomously. Users must manually invoke bug-processor-agent for features, defeating the purpose of autonomous workflow."
