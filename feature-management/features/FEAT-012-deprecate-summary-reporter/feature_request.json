  "description": "The summary-reporter-agent generates 500+ line session reports that overlap ~70% with retrospective-agent output. Analysis shows the unique value (git commit hashes, test duration stats) is marginal and can be absorbed by retrospective-agent. Removing this agent simplifies the workflow and reduces redundant documentation.",

  "user_impact": "Simplified workflow with one comprehensive report instead of two overlapping reports"
