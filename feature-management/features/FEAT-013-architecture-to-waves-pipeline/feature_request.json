  "description": "Formalize a multi-stage pipeline to transform architecture documentation into an ordered feature list for parallel development. Currently this transformation from ARCHITECTURE.md and PROJECT_SUMMARY.md to WAVES.md is done ad-hoc. This feature creates a repeatable, documented process with clear inputs and outputs at each stage: Feature Enumeration, Dependency Analysis, and Wave Generation.",

  "user_impact": "Enables repeatable, consistent project planning from architecture docs to parallelizable feature waves, reducing ad-hoc prompting and enabling git worktree-based parallel development"
