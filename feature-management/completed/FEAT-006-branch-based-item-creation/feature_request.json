  "title": "Branch-based work item creation with human-in-the-loop PR review",
  "description": "Enhance work-item-creation-agent and git-ops-agent to support creating work items on a separate branch with automatic PR creation for human review. This creates an intelligent checkpoint where humans can review, consolidate, refine, or reject auto-created items before they enter the master backlog and consume processing cycles.",
