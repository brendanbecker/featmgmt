  "description": "Both test-runner-agent and retrospective-agent now need to create bugs, features, and human actions. This logic is duplicated and should be centralized in a dedicated work-item-creation-agent that handles bug creation, feature creation, human action creation, duplicate detection, ID generation, summary file updates, and git operations.",
  "business_value": "high",
  "technical_complexity": "medium",
  "user_impact": "Centralizes issue creation logic for consistency and maintainability across all agents",
  "implementation_notes": "Created comprehensive agent definition with full documentation. Updated test-runner-agent and retrospective-agent to delegate issue creation. All acceptance criteria met."
