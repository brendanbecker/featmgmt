  "resolution_notes": "Updated both OVERPROMPT-standard.md and OVERPROMPT-gitops.md to enforce single-item processing per session. Changed session limits from 5 to 1, updated Phase 7 logic to exit after completion instead of looping, updated execution flow diagrams, and modified safeguards/exit conditions. Changes committed in cc88733.",
  "tags": ["overprompt", "workflow", "configuration"],
  "affected_versions": ["1.0.0"],
  "environment": "both standard and gitops variants",
  "reproducibility": "by design",
  "description": "OVERPROMPT.md currently allows 'max 5 items per session' but this is problematic. Without specialized agents, manual execution of 5 items is risky. It creates large, hard-to-review git commits, violates single-responsibility principle, and makes rollback difficult. The loop should exit after exactly 1 iteration, not 5.",
  "steps_to_reproduce": [
    "Open feature-management/OVERPROMPT.md",
    "See line 295: '(max 5 items per session)'",
    "See line 301: '(5 items per session)'",
    "Execute OVERPROMPT workflow with multiple queued items",
    "Observe it attempts to process up to 5 items in one session"
  ],
  "expected_behavior": "OVERPROMPT should process exactly 1 item per session, then exit to retrospective and summary reporting. This ensures focused commits, easier review, and safer rollback.",
  "actual_behavior": "OVERPROMPT allows up to 5 items per session, leading to large mixed commits and increased error risk.",
  "evidence": {
    "line_295": "OVERPROMPT.md line 295: '(max 5 items per session)'",
    "line_301": "OVERPROMPT.md line 301: '(5 items per session)'",
    "workflow_loop": "Phase 7 logic allows iteration up to 5 times"
  },
  "root_cause": "Template was designed with batch processing in mind, but practical experience shows single-item sessions are safer and more maintainable. This should be enforced, not configurable.",
  "impact": "Medium severity - doesn't break functionality but creates operational risk. Large batch commits are harder to review, debug, and rollback. Error in item 3 of 5 means items 1-2 might need to be reverted too."
