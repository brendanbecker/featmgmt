  "title": "Remove git-ops-agent - over-abstraction fragmenting agent responsibilities",
  "description": "The git-ops-agent creates unnecessary abstraction by separating git operations from the agents that own the work. Git operations (commit, push, branch) are intrinsic to each agent's responsibility, not a separate concern. Separating them fragments atomic operations and adds coordination overhead without meaningful benefit.",
