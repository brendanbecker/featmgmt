## Metrics

- **Session Duration**: ~5 minutes (estimated)
- **Items in Queue**: 4 (1 bug, 3 features)
- **Items Processed**: 1
- **Items Completed**: 1
- **Items Failed**: 0
- **Success Rate**: 100%
- **Files Modified**: 4

## Current Backlog Status

### Remaining Items (3 unresolved)
1. **FEAT-003** (P1): Create work-item-creation-agent for standardized issue creation
2. **FEAT-005** (P1): scan-prioritize-agent detects and recommends blocking human actions
3. **FEAT-004** (P2): Early-exit bug/feature creation on session failures (depends on FEAT-003)

### Recommended Next Action
Process **FEAT-003** (P1, no dependencies) to enable FEAT-004

## Observations

### Agent Availability
- ✅ scan-prioritize-agent: Available and functional
- ❌ bug-processor-agent: Not available (manual fallback used)
- ❌ git-ops-agent: Not available (manual fallback used)
- ❌ test-runner-agent: Not available (not needed for this task)
- ❌ retrospective-agent: Not available (skipped per OVERPROMPT)
- ❌ summary-reporter-agent: Not available (manual fallback used)

### Notes
- Manual fallbacks worked smoothly for all unavailable agents
- The newly implemented 1-item-per-session limit was followed successfully
- All acceptance criteria from BUG-004/PROMPT.md were met
- No issues or blockers encountered

## Recommendations

1. **Agent Installation**: Sync remaining agents to `.claude/agents/` directory:
   - bug-processor-agent
   - git-ops-agent
   - test-runner-agent
   - retrospective-agent
   - summary-reporter-agent

2. **Session Restart**: After syncing agents, restart Claude Code session for agent discovery

3. **Next Session**: Process FEAT-003 to create work-item-creation-agent infrastructure

## Session Complete

✅ All phases executed successfully
✅ BUG-004 resolved and archived
✅ Template changes committed and pushed
✅ Backlog updated and ready for next session
