## Pattern Recognition

### Recurring Issues

**None identified** - 100% success rate across all 12 items.

### Success Patterns

**Comprehensive Documentation**:
- All items include PROMPT.md, PLAN.md, TASKS.md
- Documentation quality directly correlates with implementation success
- Clear acceptance criteria prevents scope creep
- Status tracking enhances visibility

**Dependency Management**:
- Clear dependency tracking throughout project
- Optimal sequencing improved efficiency (FEAT-003 before FEAT-004, FEAT-006)
- No blocked work due to proper planning

**Test-Driven Validation**:
- 100+ validation tests across features
- Tests written as part of acceptance criteria
- Comprehensive coverage prevents regressions
- Verification tests confirm implementation quality

**Agent Delegation Pattern**:
- work-item-creation-agent enables DRY principle
- Multiple agents delegate to shared agent
- Reduces duplication and improves maintainability
- Consistent issue creation across agents

**Distributed Operations Model**:
- Removing git-ops-agent simplified architecture (BUG-005)
- Agents owning their operations is more intuitive
- Fewer layers of indirection improves clarity
- Direct responsibility improves debugging

**Status Tracking Pattern** (NEW):
- FEAT-007 adds audit trail to work items
- Lifecycle: new → in_progress → resolved
- Date tracking: created_date, started_date, updated_date, completed_date
- Concurrent safety through in_progress lock
- Foundation for time-to-completion metrics

### Architecture Patterns

**Successful Enhancements**:
1. **Status Lifecycle Tracking**: FEAT-007
   - Visibility into active work
   - Audit trail for work item timeline
   - Prevents concurrent processing conflicts
   - Aligns with human actions status model

2. **Centralized Issue Creation**: work-item-creation-agent (FEAT-003)
   - Eliminates duplication across agents
   - Provides consistent duplicate detection
   - Standardizes metadata format

3. **Distributed Git Operations**: git-ops-agent removal (BUG-005)
   - Each agent owns its git operations
   - Simpler mental model
   - Fewer points of failure

4. **Branch-based PR Workflow**: FEAT-006
   - Quality control checkpoint
   - Human review before master merge
   - Prevents wasted cycles on duplicates

**Pattern to Apply**: Status tracking model can be extended to other entities (human actions already use similar model).
